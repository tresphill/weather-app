<!-- DESCRIPTION

For this project, we will be using an external API to retrieve weather data to create a webpage that prompts users to enter a zip code, then displays current weather information for that location or a friendly error message if the zip code is not found. -->

<!-- REQUIREMENTS
To complete the assignment, you must complete the following:
Use https://openweathermap.org/’s API to fetch weather data.
Allow the user to enter their location (zip code is probably easiest) and press a button to load the weather.
Run an onClick or onSubmit that executes an Axios GET request to retrieve weather data from the API.
Handle successful and unsuccessful attempts
If the request is successful, display the following in a 'mobile app' format:
City name
Current weather conditions
Current temperature in Kelvin, Fahrenheit, and Celsius
A unique image, decided by the current temperature (The API has icons built-in, be sure to read the docs)
If the request is unsuccessful, display a specific error message such as "Invalid Zip Code" or anything else that might come back from the API.
Allow the user to continue entering new zip codes to get new weather data.
Design should include a RESPONSIVE layout utilizing Bootstrap’s layout classes that works on both mobile and desktop (with different layouts) and applies atomic design principles for a professional looking presentation. -->

    <!-- Understanding the problem
its a weather application that allows the user to enter their zip code and it displays the weather for their location
i will need an input field for entering zip along with a button to getWeather
the information will be retrieved using an API, not fetch
i will need a display box containing info such as City, Temps (kelvin, Fahrenheit, Celsius), the condition of the weather at current time,
and any other info such an image relative to the weathers conditions in that city
i will also need defensive programming such as an error message if zip code is incorrect, zip code is not valid(only for US) -->


    <!-- Functionality
basic html file with single div, adding nesting divs to be populated by JS - .createElement 
css to style as needed, not as important right now
use API key(0bd53a711178ff89e0b82fd78dc9c36a) to populate city, temp, weather conditions, images, error messages
    i. axios.get to retrieve data 
    ii. store data in state and render?
    iii. onCLick button handler to render weather info
    iiii. if statements for error messages?
